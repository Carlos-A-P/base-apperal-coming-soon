### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first project using javascript! It was alot of fun and I learned how to use functions to achieve results. I also learned how to use the debugger tool which helped out alot.

```Javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) =>{
    debugger
    e.preventDefault();
    checkInputs();
});
```

### Questions
